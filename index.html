                <br>
                <p>Apollo 13 was launched on April 11, 1970, for what was planned to be the third human landing 
                    on the Moon. The crew included Commander Jim Lovell and Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise, who 
                    were scheduled to land in the lunar module Aquarius and explore the Fra Mauro region of the 
                    Moon. Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly would remain in lunar orbit in the command module 
                    Odyssey. However, four days prior to launch, it was determined that Mattingly had been exposed 
                    to measles and had no immunity. In order to avoid the possibility of Mattingly becoming sick 
                    during the flight, he was replaced by his back up, Jack Swigert.</p>
                    
                    <br>
                    <p>On the third day of the mission, when the spacecraft was nearly 200,000 miles from Earth, the 
                        routine activation of a fan in one of the service module's oxygen tanks led to a short circuit 
                        and an explosion in that tank. As a result, both oxygen tanks ruptured and vented their contents 
                        to space. The lunar landing was cancelled and the crew used the lunar module as a life boat 
                        to sustain them for the return trip back to Earth. The lunar module was designed to support 2
                        people for 2 days and was suddenly required to support 3 people for nearly 4 days. The crew 
                        subsisted on 6 ounces of water per person a day. Power was severely rationed, and the temperature 
                        inside the cabin dropped below 40 °F (4 °C), causing the crew great difficulty sleeping. The two 
                        spacecraft both used lithium hydroxide canisters to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but 
                        the canisters had different shapes on the two spacecraft. CO2 levels were approaching dangerous 
                        levels when Mission Control designed a system using plastic bags, cardboard, and duct tape that 
                        allowed Aquarius to successfully use lithium hydroxide canisters from Odyssey. The crew used the
                        engines on Aquarius to make three trajectory correction maneuvers that were needed to reach the 
                        landing zone in the Pacific Ocean. When Odyssey entered Earth's atmosphere, it was unknown if 
                        the explosion had damaged the spacecraft's heat shield; fortunately, it was undamaged. Because 
                        of the low cabin temperature, atmospheric humidity had condensed, covering the cabin interior 
                        with drops of liquid water that fell as rain during the reentry. Despite these dangers, the crew 
                        landed safely near Samoa six days after the mission began.</p>
                        
                    <br>
                    <p>A post-mission investigation revealed that the explosion was a result of a change made to the spacecraft 
                    design in 1965, when the heaters in the oxygen tanks were changed from 28 volts to 65 volts. Unfortunately, 
                    the switches in the tank that exploded were not changed to handle the higher voltage, resulting in 
                    unrecognized damage during a ground test two weeks before the launch and ultimately in the short circuit 
                    during flight. As a safety measure, later Apollo spacecraft were modified to include a third oxygen 
                    tank that was isolated from the first two tanks and also included additional emergency battery power.</p>
